#Mochi: The Interactive Desk Pet

Mochi is a 3D-printed, WiFi-connected desk companion that displays the time and reacts to your touch and any type of movement.I made this mini desk robot to get relaxed when am in my desk for long time, it will help me to check the time also. Whenever am doing my long homework and project works I feel bored and tired and I don't have table clock also so that I planned to make this Mochi robot.
